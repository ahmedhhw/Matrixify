# Matrixify
Accepts any matrix of any dimension and reduces it to reduced Echelon form
Reason I'm developing this is to eliminate the tediusness of entering a matrix
that is usually found in other mobile based matrix apps.
This app works by accepting a single row's members at a time with the numbers being
seperated with spaces.
